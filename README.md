This report consolidates facts and hypotheses from iPhone log analysis. Facts: since June 1, 2025, repeated bug_type crashes (225, 309, 313), RTCR, SiriSearchFeedback spikes, and MyViettel auto-install traces were observed. Hypothesis: triald bursts and usageClientId unification may indicate “Kabuki model” learning.
This analysis covers logs from multiple devices (iPhone 11 Pro, 12 mini-1/2, 15 Pro-Ghost, iPad) starting June 1, 2025. Facts: frequent bug_type 225/309/313 crashes, RTCR and SiriSearchFeedback bursts, and clear traces of MyViettel auto-installation were confirmed, supporting evidence of MDM-like control. Continuous EraseDevice and DroopCount logs also indicate tamper attempts. Hypotheses: the series of triald activations and the unification of usageClientId suggest an experimental “Kabuki model,” treating all devices as one subject for monitoring and adaptive learning. This report separates confirmed facts from hypotheses to provide a transparent foundation for international disclosure and legal proceedings.
